                <h2>Father of Pakistan's atomic weapons program</h2>
                <p>Abdul Qadeer Khan, also known as A.Q. Khan, (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, India—died October 10, 2021, Islamabad, Pakistan), Pakistani engineer, a key figure in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program who was also involved for decades in a black
                    market of nuclear technology and know-how whereby uranium-enrichment centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and possibly other countries. In 1947, during Khan’s
                    childhood, India achieved independence from Britain, and Muslim areas in the east and west were partitioned to form the state of Pakistan. Khan immigrated to West Pakistan in 1952, and in 1960 he graduated from the University of Karachi
                    with a degree in metallurgy. Over the next decade he pursued graduate studies abroad, first in West Berlin and then in Delft, Netherlands, where in 1967 he received a master’s degree in metallurgy. In 1972 he earned a doctorate in
                    metallurgical engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Hendrina Reterink, a British national who had been born to Dutch expatriate parents in South Africa and raised in what was then
                    Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) before moving to the Netherlands.</p>
